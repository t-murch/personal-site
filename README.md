### Hey there
 - Yes, this is over engineered for a silly personal site.
 - In my last working role I didn't have much opportunity to use some of the more modern Frameworks/tech to be released.
 - Some of those things being:
   - SSR React since I hadn't had the opportunity in my last working role.
     - I only chose NextJS as it _appears_ to be more in demand in the market.
     - I want to dive into Remix later on. 
   - Serverless infra/deployments.
   - Monorepos + polyglot - My next service added to this will be in Golang as I want to explore that as well. 
 - I plan to also use it as a personal playground, that's why there's a random spotify page.
