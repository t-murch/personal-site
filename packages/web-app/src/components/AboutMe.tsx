        A software developer with 3+ years of experience based in Austin, TX. I
        work across the stack with a specialization in front-end development
        building solutions in NodeJS with TypeScript. I believe in maintaining
        high standards, open communication, and an us mindset in accomplishing
        goals. I started at IBM in 2019 where I worked with Solution Architects
        to move Client workloads to IBM & Redhat Cloud services. I then
        transitioned into a web-application development with Khoros in April
        2021 where I maintained and built upon the Care product on the Response
        Team. Responsibilities ranged from building new features in React and/or
        Java, resolving bugs reported by clients, QEs, or support staff.
